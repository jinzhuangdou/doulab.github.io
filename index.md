We are a multidisciplinary team working at the intersection of Statistics, Computer Science, and Biology to develop new ways to think about and work with genomic data. 

We are excited by the rich new data types generated by recent technology, such as single cell sequencing  and spatial transcriptomic imaging. We like to cast biological problems into quantitative models.  We strive to develop transparent, scalable methods, and apply to those methods to answer questions in biology and medicine.

We are situated in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

We are always looking for motivated students and postdocs to join us.  If you are interested, please contact the PI.
