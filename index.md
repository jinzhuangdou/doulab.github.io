## Zhang Statistical Genomics Lab @ UPENN

We are a **multidisciplinary team** working at the intersection of **Statistics**, **Computer Science**, and **Biology**, seeking new ways to think about and work with genomic data. 

We are excited by the rich **new data types coming from recent technology**, such as single cell sequencing  and spatial transcriptomic imaging. **These rich data types allow us to ask new questions about biological phenomena, and we like to cast these questions into quantitative models.**  

We strive to develop **transparent and scalable methods**, and apply these methods to answer questions in biology and medicine.

We are looking for motivated students and postdocs to join us.  If you are interested, please contact the PI.
