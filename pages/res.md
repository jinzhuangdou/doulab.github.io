            We describe [Monopogen](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01873-x) (Dou et al., 2023 Nature Biotech.) to detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) from single-cell sequencing data. Monopogen-derived genotypes enable global and local ancestry inference and identification of admixed samples. It identifies variants associated with cellular phenotypes and also improves putative somatic SNV detection that enables clonal lineage tracing in cancer studies. <br/>

            Because of Singapore's unique immigration history, the [SG10K project](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31070-0?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email) (Wu*, Dou*, Chai* et al., 2019 Cell) provides a snapshot of the genetic diversity across East, Southeast, and South Asia, and unravels insights into the population structure, demographic history, and natural selection of Asian populations. This paper was featured on the [Cover of Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/issue?pii=S0092-8674(18)X0022-1#fullCover). <br/>
